   'Elle etait fille, elle etait amoureuse'—Malfilatre

   Canto The Third

   [Note: Odessa and Mikhailovskoe, 1824.]

   I

   "Whither away? Deuce take the bard!"—
   "Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go."—
   "I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
   To guess how you the eve pull through."—
   "At Larina's."—"Hem, that is queer!
   Pray is it not a tough affair
   Thus to assassinate the eve?"—
   "Not at all."—"That I can't conceive!
   'Tis something of this sort I deem.
   In the first place, say, am I right?
   A Russian household simple quite,
   Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
   Preserves and an eternal prattle
   About the rain and flax and cattle."—

   II

   "No misery I see in that"—
   "Boredom, my friend, behold the ill—"
   "Your fashionable world I hate,
   Domestic life attracts me still,
   Where—"—"What! another eclogue spin?
   For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
   What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
   But Lenski, I should be so glad
   Would you to me this Phyllis show,
   Fair source of every fine idea,
   Verses and tears et cetera.
   Present me."—"You are joking."—"No."—
   "Delighted."—"When?"—"This very night.
   They will receive us with delight."

   III

   Whilst homeward by the nearest route
   Our heroes at full gallop sped,
   Can we not stealthily make out
   What they in conversation said?—
   "How now, Oneguine, yawning still?"—
   "'Tis habit, Lenski."—"Is your ill
   More troublesome than usual?"—"No!
   How dark the night is getting though!
   Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
   The drive becomes monotonous—
   Well! Larina appears to us
   An ancient lady full of grace.—
   That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
   The deuce with my inside has played."

   IV

   "Say, of the two which was Tattiana?"
   "She who with melancholy face
   And silent as the maid Svetlana(30)
   Hard by the window took her place."—
   "The younger, you're in love with her!"
   "Well!"—"I the elder should prefer,
   Were I like you a bard by trade—
   In Olga's face no life's displayed.
   'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
   An oval countenance and pink,
   Yon silly moon upon the brink
   Of the horizon she is like!"—
   Vladimir something curtly said
   Nor further comment that night made.

   [Note 30: "Svetlana," a short poem by Joukovski, upon which his
   fame mainly rests. Joukovski was an unblushing plagiarist. Many
   eminent English poets have been laid under contribution by him,
   often without going through the form of acknowledging the
   source of inspiration. Even the poem in question cannot be
   pronounced entirely original, though its intrinsic beauty is
   unquestionable. It undoubtedly owes its origin to Burger's poem
   "Leonora," which has found so many English translators. Not
   content with a single development of Burger's ghastly production
   the Russian poet has directly paraphrased "Leonora" under its
   own title, and also written a poem "Liudmila" in imitation of it.
   The principal outlines of these three poems are as follows: A
   maiden loses her lover in the wars; she murmurs at Providence
   and is vainly reproved for such blasphemy by her mother.
   Providence at length loses patience and sends her lover's spirit,
   to all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate
   maiden to elope. Instead of riding to a church or bridal chamber
   the unpleasant bridegroom resorts to the graveyard and repairs to
   his own grave, from which he has recently issued to execute his
   errand. It is a repulsive subject. "Svetlana," however, is more
   agreeable than its prototype "Leonora," inasmuch as the whole
   catastrophe turns out a dream brought on by "sorcery," during the
   "sviatki" or Holy Nights (see Canto V. st. x), and the dreamer
   awakes to hear the tinkling of her lover's sledge approaching.
   "Svetlana" has been translated by Sir John Bowring.]

   V

   Meantime Oneguine's apparition
   At Larina's abode produced
   Quite a sensation; the position
   To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
   Endless conjectures all propound
   And secretly their views expound.
   What jokes and guesses now abound,
   A beau is for Tattiana found!
   In fact, some people were assured
   The wedding-day had been arranged,
   But the date subsequently changed
   Till proper rings could be procured.
   On Lenski's matrimonial fate
   They long ago had held debate.

   VI

   Of course Tattiana was annoyed
   By such allusions scandalous,
   Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
   With satisfaction marvellous,
   As in her heart the thought sank home,
   I am in love, my hour hath come!
   Thus in the earth the seed expands
   Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
   Long time her young imagination
   By indolence and languor fired
   The fated nutriment desired;
   And long internal agitation
   Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
   She waited for—I don't know whom!

   VII

   The fatal hour had come at last—
   She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
   Alas! for now before her passed
   The same warm vision constantly;
   Now all things round about repeat
   Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
   His name: the tenderness of home
   Tiresome unto her hath become
   And the kind-hearted servitors:
   Immersed in melancholy thought,
   She hears of conversation nought
   And hated casual visitors,
   Their coming which no man expects,
   And stay whose length none recollects.

   VIII

   Now with what eager interest
   She the delicious novel reads,
   With what avidity and zest
   She drinks in those seductive deeds!
   All the creations which below
   From happy inspiration flow,
   The swain of Julia Wolmar,
   Malek Adel and De Linar,(31)
   Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
   And that unrivalled paragon,
   The sleep-compelling Grandison,
   Our tender dreamer had enrolled
   A single being: 'twas in fine
   No other than Oneguine mine.

   [Note 31: The heroes of two romances much in vogue in Pushkin's
   time: the former by Madame Cottin, the latter by the famous
   Madame Krudener. The frequent mention in the course of this
   poem of romances once enjoying a European celebrity but now
   consigned to oblivion, will impress the reader with the
   transitory nature of merely mediocre literary reputation. One
   has now to search for the very names of most of the popular
   authors of Pushkin's day and rummage biographical dictionaries
   for the dates of their births and deaths. Yet the poet's prime
   was but fifty years ago, and had he lived to a ripe old age he
   would have been amongst us still. He was four years younger
   than the late Mr. Thomas Carlyle. The decadence of Richardson's
   popularity amongst his countrymen is a fact familiar to all.]

   IX

   Dreaming herself the heroine
   Of the romances she preferred,
   Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,—(32)
   Tattiana through the forest erred,
   And the bad book accompanies.
   Upon those pages she descries
   Her passion's faithful counterpart,
   Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
   She heaves a sigh and deep intent
   On raptures, sorrows not her own,
   She murmurs in an undertone
   A letter for her hero meant:
   That hero, though his merit shone,
   Was certainly no Grandison.

   [Note 32: Referring to Richardson's "Clarissa Harlowe," "La
   Nouvelle Heloise," and Madame de Stael's "Delphine."]

   X

   Alas! my friends, the years flit by
   And after them at headlong pace
   The evanescent fashions fly
   In motley and amusing chase.
   The world is ever altering!
   Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
   And courtier, fop, and usurer
   Would once in powdered wig appear;
   Time was, the poet's tender quill
   In hopes of everlasting fame
   A finished madrigal would frame
   Or couplets more ingenious still;
   Time was, a valiant general might
   Serve who could neither read nor write.

   XI

   Time was, in style magniloquent
   Authors replete with sacred fire
   Their heroes used to represent
   All that perfection could desire;
   Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
   Their idols they were wont to invest
   With intellect, a taste refined,
   And handsome countenance combined,
   A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
   The excited hero in a trice
   Was ready for self-sacrifice,
   And in the final tome we learnt,
   Vice had due punishment awarded,
   Virtue was with a bride rewarded.

   XII

   But now our minds are mystified
   And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
   Vice in romance is glorified
   And triumphs in career erotic.
   The monsters of the British Muse
   Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
   The idols of their adoration
   A Vampire fond of meditation,
   Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
   The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
   Or the mysterious Sbogar.(33)
   Byron's capricious phantasy
   Could in romantic mantle drape
   E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.

   [Note 33: "Melmoth," a romance by Maturin, and "Jean Sbogar," by
   Ch. Nodier. "The Vampire," a tale published in 1819, was
   erroneously attributed to Lord Byron. "Salathiel; the Eternal
   Jew," a romance by Geo. Croly.]

   XIII

   My friends, what means this odd digression?
   May be that I by heaven's decrees
   Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
   And shall adopt some new caprice.
   Thus having braved Apollo's rage
   With humble prose I'll fill my page
   And a romance in ancient style
   Shall my declining years beguile;
   Nor shall my pen paint terribly
   The torment born of crime unseen,
   But shall depict the touching scene
   Of Russian domesticity;
   I will descant on love's sweet dream,
   The olden time shall be my theme.

   XIV

   Old people's simple conversations
   My unpretending page shall fill,
   Their offspring's innocent flirtations
   By the old lime-tree or the rill,
   Their Jealousy and separation
   And tears of reconciliation:
   Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
   But finally in wedlock bind.
   The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
   Accents of rapture or despair
   I uttered to my lady fair
   Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
   Then they came easily enow,
   My tongue is somewhat rusty now.

   XV

   Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
   What bitter tears with thee I shed!
   Thou hast resigned thy destiny
   Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
   Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
   Hope with her fascinating power
   To dire contentment shall give birth
   And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
   Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
   Fantastic images shall swarm
   In thy imagination warm,
   Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
   And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
   Confront thy fated torturer!

   XVI

   Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
   She seeks the garden in her need—
   Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
   And cares not farther to proceed;
   Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
   With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
   Barely to draw her breath she seems,
   Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
   And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
   Sails her allotted course on high,
   And from the misty woodland nigh
   The nightingale trills forth her tune;
   Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
   And thus unto her nurse did say:

   XVII

   "Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
   Open the window—sit by me."
   "What ails thee, dear?"—"I feel depressed.
   Relate some ancient history."
   "But which, my dear?—In days of yore
   Within my memory I bore
   Many an ancient legend which
   In monsters and fair dames was rich;
   But now my mind is desolate,
   What once I knew is clean forgot—
   Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
   "But tell me, nurse, can you relate
   The days which to your youth belong?
   Were you in love when you were young?"—

   XVIII

   "Alack! Tattiana," she replied,
   "We never loved in days of old,
   My mother-in-law who lately died(34)
   Had killed me had the like been told."
   "How came you then to wed a man?"—
   "Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
   Was younger than myself, my light,
   For I myself was thirteen quite;(35)
   The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
   Her suit before my parents pressing:
   At last my father gave his blessing,
   And bitter tears of fright I shed.
   Weeping they loosed my tresses long(36)
   And led me off to church with song."

   [Note 34: A young married couple amongst Russian peasants
   reside in the house of the bridegroom's father till the
   "tiaglo," or family circle is broken up by his death.]

   [Note 35: Marriages amongst Russian serfs used formerly to
   take place at ridiculously early ages. Haxthausen asserts
   that strong hearty peasant women were to be seen at work
   in the fields with their infant husbands in their arms. The
   inducement lay in the fact that the "tiaglo" (see previous
   note) received an additional lot of the communal land for
   every male added to its number, though this could have formed
   an inducement in the southern and fertile provinces of Russia
   only, as it is believed that agriculture in the north is so
   unremunerative that land has often to be forced upon the
   peasants, in order that the taxes, for which the whole Commune
   is responsible to Government, may be paid. The abuse of early
   marriages was regulated by Tsar Nicholas.]

   [Note 36: Courtships were not unfrequently carried on in the
   larger villages, which alone could support such an individual,
   by means of a "svakha," or matchmaker. In Russia unmarried
   girls wear their hair in a single long plait or tail, "kossa;"
   the married women, on the other hand, in two, which are twisted
   into the head-gear.]

   XIX

   "Then amongst strangers I was left—
   But I perceive thou dost not heed—"
   "Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
   Mortally sick I am indeed.
   Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain—"
   "My darling child, thou art in pain.—
   The Lord deliver her and save!
   Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
   I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.—
   How thy hands burn!"—"Dear nurse, I'm well.
   I am—in love—you know—don't tell!"
   "The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!"—
   And the old nurse a brief prayer said
   And crossed with trembling hand the maid.

   XX

   "I am in love," her whispers tell
   The aged woman in her woe:
   "My heart's delight, thou art not well."—
   "I am in love, nurse! leave me now."
   Behold! the moon was shining bright
   And showed with an uncertain light
   Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
   Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
   And on the footstool sitting down
   Beside our youthful heroine fair,
   A kerchief round her silver hair
   The aged nurse in ample gown,(37)
   Whilst all creation seemed to dream
   Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.

   [Note 37: It is thus that I am compelled to render a female
   garment not known, so far as I am aware, to Western Europe.
   It is called by the natives "doushegreika," that is to say,
   "warmer of the soul"—in French, chaufferette de l'ame. It
   is a species of thick pelisse worn over the "sarafan," or
   gown.]

   XXI

   But borne in spirit far away
   Tattiana gazes on the moon,
   And starting suddenly doth say:
   "Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
   Pen, paper bring: the table too
   Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go—
   Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
   'Tis silent—on her shines the moon—
   Upon her elbow she reclines,
   And Eugene ever in her soul
   Indites an inconsiderate scroll
   Wherein love innocently pines.
   Now it is ready to be sent—
   For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?

   XXII

   I have known beauties cold and raw
   As Winter in their purity,
   Striking the intellect with awe
   By dull insensibility,
   And I admired their common sense
   And natural benevolence,
   But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
   For on their brows I trembling read
   The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
   "Abandon hope for ever here!"(38)
   Love to inspire doth woe appear
   To such—delightful to repel.
   Perchance upon the Neva e'en
   Similar dames ye may have seen.

   [Note 38: A Russian annotator complains that the poet has
   mutilated Dante's famous line.]

   XXIII

   Amid submissive herds of men
   Virgins miraculous I see,
   Who selfishly unmoved remain
   Alike by sighs and flattery.
   But what astonished do I find
   When harsh demeanour hath consigned
   A timid love to banishment?—
   On fresh allurements they are bent,
   At least by show of sympathy;
   At least their accents and their words
   Appear attuned to softer chords;
   And then with blind credulity
   The youthful lover once again
   Pursues phantasmagoria vain.

   XXIV

   Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?—
   Because in singleness of thought
   She never of deception dreamed
   But trusted the ideal she wrought?—
   Because her passion wanted art,
   Obeyed the impulses of heart?—
   Because she was so innocent,
   That Heaven her character had blent
   With an imagination wild,
   With intellect and strong volition
   And a determined disposition,
   An ardent heart and yet so mild?—
   Doth love's incautiousness in her
   So irremissible appear?

   XXV

   O ye whom tender love hath pained
   Without the ken of parents both,
   Whose hearts responsive have remained
   To the impressions of our youth,
   The all-entrancing joys of love—
   Young ladies, if ye ever strove
   The mystic lines to tear away
   A lover's letter might convey,
   Or into bold hands anxiously
   Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
   Or even, silent and resigned,
   When separation's hour drew nigh,
   Have felt love's agitated kiss
   With tears, confused emotions, bliss,—

   XXVI

   With unanimity complete,
   Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
   Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
   The sneers of critics superfine;
   And you, O maids immaculate,
   Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
   E'en as the presence of a snake,
   I the same admonition make.
   Who knows? with love's consuming flame
   Perchance you also soon may burn,
   Then to some gallant in your turn
   Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
   The triumph of a conquest new.
   The God of Love is after you!

   XXVII

   A coquette loves by calculation,
   Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
   A love which knew no limitation,
   Even as the love of children dear.
   She did not think "procrastination
   Enhances love in estimation
   And thus secures the prey we seek.
   His vanity first let us pique
   With hope and then perplexity,
   Excruciate the heart and late
   With jealous fire resuscitate,
   Lest jaded with satiety,
   The artful prisoner should seek
   Incessantly his chains to break."

   XXVIII

   I still a complication view,
   My country's honour and repute
   Demands that I translate for you
   The letter which Tattiana wrote.
   At Russ she was by no means clever
   And read our newspapers scarce ever,
   And in her native language she
   Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
   So she in French herself expressed.
   I cannot help it I declare,
   Though hitherto a lady ne'er
   In Russ her love made manifest,
   And never hath our language proud
   In correspondence been allowed.(39)

   [Note 39: It is well known that until the reign of the late Tsar
   French was the language of the Russian court and of Russian
   fashionable society. It should be borne in mind that at the time
   this poem was written literary warfare more or less open was
   being waged between two hostile schools of Russian men of
   letters. These consisted of the <i>Arzamass</i>, or French school, to
   which Pushkin himself together with his uncle Vassili Pushkin
   the "Nestor of the Arzamass" belonged, and their opponents who
   devoted themselves to the cultivation of the vernacular.]

   XXIX

   They wish that ladies should, I hear,
   Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
   I can't conceive a little dear
   With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!(40)
   I ask, all ye who poets are,
   Is it not true? the objects fair,
   To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
   Had to compose in secret rhymes,
   To whom your hearts were consecrate,—
   Did they not all the Russian tongue
   With little knowledge and that wrong
   In charming fashion mutilate?
   Did not their lips with foreign speech
   The native Russian tongue impeach?

   [Note 40: The "Blago-Namierenni," or "Well-Wisher," was an
   inferior Russian newspaper of the day, much scoffed at by
   contemporaries. The editor once excused himself for some
   gross error by pleading that he had been "on the loose."]

   XXX

   God grant I meet not at a ball
   Or at a promenade mayhap,
   A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
   Or a professor in tulle cap.
   As rosy lips without a smile,
   The Russian language I deem vile
   Without grammatical mistakes.
   May be, and this my terror wakes,
   The fair of the next generation,
   As every journal now entreats,
   Will teach grammatical conceits,
   Introduce verse in conversation.
   But I—what is all this to me?
   Will to the old times faithful be.

   XXXI

   Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
   With inexact pronunciation
   Raises within my breast as oft
   As formerly much agitation.
   Repentance wields not now her spell
   And gallicisms I love as well
   As the sins of my youthful days
   Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.(41)
   But I must now employ my Muse
   With the epistle of my fair;
   I promised!—Did I so?—Well, there!
   Now I am ready to refuse.
   I know that Parny's tender pen(42)
   Is no more cherished amongst men.

   [Note 41: Hippolyte Bogdanovitch—b. 1743, d. 1803—though
   possessing considerable poetical talent was like many other
   Russian authors more remarkable for successful imitation
   than for original genius. His most remarkable production
   is "Doushenka," "The Darling," a composition somewhat in
   the style of La Fontaine's "Psyche." Its merit consists in
   graceful phraseology, and a strong pervading sense of humour.]

   [Note 42: Parny—a French poet of the era of the first Napoleon,
   b. 1753, d. 1814. Introduced to the aged Voltaire during
   his last visit to Paris, the patriarch laid his hands upon
   the youth's head and exclaimed: "Mon cher Tibulle." He is
   chiefly known for his erotic poetry which attracted the
   affectionate regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student
   at the Lyceum. We regret to add that, having accepted a
   pension from Napoleon, Parny forthwith proceeded to damage
   his literary reputation by inditing an "epic" poem entitled
   "Goddam! Goddam! par un French—Dog." It is descriptive
   of the approaching conquest of Britain by Napoleon, and
   treats the embryo enterprise as if already conducted to a
   successful conclusion and become matter of history. A good
   account of the bard and his creations will be found in the
   <i>Saturday Review</i> of the 2d August 1879.]

   XXXII

   Bard of the "Feasts," and mournful breast,(43)
   If thou wert sitting by my side,
   With this immoderate request
   I should alarm our friendship tried:
   In one of thine enchanting lays
   To russify the foreign phrase
   Of my impassioned heroine.
   Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
   I yield with a low reverence;
   But lonely beneath Finnish skies
   Where melancholy rocks arise
   He wanders in his indolence;
   Careless of fame his spirit high
   Hears not my importunity!

   [Note 43: Evgeny Baratynski, a contemporary of Pushkin and a
   lyric poet of some originality and talent. The "Feasts" is
   a short brilliant poem in praise of conviviality. Pushkin
   is therein praised as the best of companions "beside the
   bottle."]

   XXXIII

   Tattiana's letter I possess,
   I guard it as a holy thing,
   And though I read it with distress,
   I'm o'er it ever pondering.
   Inspired by whom this tenderness,
   This gentle daring who could guess?
   Who this soft nonsense could impart,
   Imprudent prattle of the heart,
   Attractive in its banefulness?
   I cannot understand. But lo!
   A feeble version read below,
   A print without the picture's grace,
   Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
   Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Tattiana's Letter to Oneguine

   I write to you! Is more required?
   Can lower depths beyond remain?
   'Tis in your power now, if desired,
   To crush me with a just disdain.
   But if my lot unfortunate
   You in the least commiserate
   You will not all abandon me.
   At first, I clung to secrecy:
   Believe me, of my present shame
   You never would have heard the name,
   If the fond hope I could have fanned
   At times, if only once a week,
   To see you by our fireside stand,
   To listen to the words you speak,
   Address to you one single phrase
   And then to meditate for days
   Of one thing till again we met.
   'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
   In country solitude you mope,
   And we—an unattractive set—
   Can hearty welcome give alone.
   Why did you visit our poor place?
   Forgotten in the village lone,
   I never should have seen your face
   And bitter torment never known.
   The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
   By time (who can anticipate?)
   I had found my predestinate,
   Become a faithful wife and e'en
   A fond and careful mother been.

   Another! to none other I
   My heart's allegiance can resign,
   My doom has been pronounced on high,
   'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
   The sum of my existence gone
   But promise of our meeting gave,
   I feel thou wast by God sent down
   My guardian angel to the grave.
   Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
   Unseen thou wast already dear.
   Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
   I heard thy voice's resonance
   Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
   Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
   I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
   And cried within myself: 'tis he!
   Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
   With thee I conversed when I bore
   Comfort and succour to the poor,
   And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
   To ease the anguish of my breast.
   Nay! even as this instant fled,
   Was it not thou, O vision bright,
   That glimmered through the radiant night
   And gently hovered o'er my head?
   Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
   To whisper comfort, love and hope?
   Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
   Or torturer malevolent?
   Doubt and uncertainty decide:
   All this may be an empty dream,
   Delusions of a mind untried,
   Providence otherwise may deem—
   Then be it so! My destiny
   From henceforth I confide to thee!
   Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
   And thy protection I implore.
   Imagine! Here alone am I!
   No one my anguish comprehends,
   At times my reason almost bends,
   And silently I here must die—
   But I await thee: scarce alive
   My heart with but one look revive;
   Or to disturb my dreams approach
   Alas! with merited reproach.

   'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
   With shame I shudder and with dread—
   But boldly I myself resign:
   Thine honour is my countersign!

   XXXIV

   Tattiana moans and now she sighs
   And in her grasp the letter shakes,
   Even the rosy wafer dries
   Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
   Her head upon her breast declines
   And an enchanting shoulder shines
   From her half-open vest of night.
   But lo! already the moon's light
   Is waning. Yonder valley deep
   Looms gray behind the mist and morn
   Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
   Arouses rustics from their sleep.
   'Tis day, the family downstairs,
   But nought for this Tattiana cares.

   XXXV

   The break of day she doth not see,
   But sits in bed with air depressed,
   Nor on the letter yet hath she
   The image of her seal impressed.
   But gray Phillippevna the door
   Opened with care, and entering bore
   A cup of tea upon a tray.
   "'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
   My beauty, thou art ready too.
   My morning birdie, yesternight
   I was half silly with affright.
   But praised be God! in health art thou!
   The pains of night have wholly fled,
   Thy cheek is as a poppy red!"

   XXXVI

   "Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"
   "Command me, darling, what you choose"
   "Do not—you might—suspicious be;
   But look you—ah! do not refuse."
   "I call to witness God on high—"
   "Then send your grandson quietly
   To take this letter to O— Well!
   Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell—
   Command him not to say a word—
   I mean my name not to repeat."
   "To whom is it to go, my sweet?
   Of late I have been quite absurd,—
   So many neighbours here exist—
   Am I to go through the whole list?"

   XXXVII

   "How dull you are this morning, nurse!"
   "My darling, growing old am I!
   In age the memory gets worse,
   But I was sharp in times gone by.
   In times gone by thy bare command—"
   "Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
   What is thy cleverness to me?
   The letter is the thing, you see,—
   Oneguine's letter!"—"Ah! the thing!
   Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
   You know that I am now a fool—
   But why are your cheeks whitening?"
   "Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
   But send your grandson before long."

   XXXVIII

   No answer all that day was borne.
   Another passed; 'twas just the same.
   Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
   Tattiana waits. No answer came!
   Olga's admirer came that day:
   "Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"
   The hostess doth interrogate:
   "He hath neglected us of late."—
   Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick—
   "He promised here this day to ride,"
   Lenski unto the dame replied,
   "The post hath kept him, it is like."
   Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
   As if he cruelly had joked!

   XXXIX

   'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
   Shrill sang the <i>samovar</i> at eve,(44)
   The china teapot too ye might
   In clouds of steam above perceive.
   Into the cups already sped
   By Olga's hand distributed
   The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
   And a boy handed round the cream.
   Tania doth by the casement linger
   And breathes upon the chilly glass,
   Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
   And traces with a slender finger
   Upon its damp opacity,
   The mystic monogram, O. E.

   [Note 44: The <i>samovar</i>, i.e. "self-boiler," is merely an
   urn for hot water having a fire in the center. We may observe
   a similar contrivance in our own old-fashioned tea-urns which
   are provided with a receptacle for a red-hot iron cylinder in
   center. The tea-pot is usually placed on the top of the
   <i>samovar</i>.]

   In the meantime her spirit sinks,
   Her weary eyes are filled with tears—
   A horse's hoofs she hears—She shrinks!
   Nearer they come—Eugene appears!
   Ah! than a spectre from the dead
   More swift the room Tattiana fled,
   From hall to yard and garden flies,
   Not daring to cast back her eyes.
   She fears and like an arrow rushes
   Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
   The bridge and alley to the lake,
   Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
   The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
   Till out of breath upon a seat

   XLI

   She sank.—
      "He's here! Eugene is here!
   Merciful God, what will he deem?"
   Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
   Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
   She waits, on fire her trembling frame—
   Will he pursue?—But no one came.
   She heard of servant-maids the note,
   Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
   Singing in chorus all the while.
   (This by command; for it was found,
   However cherries might abound,
   They disappeared by stealth and guile,
   So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit—
   Device of rural minds acute!)

   The Maidens' Song

   Young maidens, fair maidens,
   Friends and companions,
   Disport yourselves, maidens,
   Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
   Come sing we in chorus
   The secrets of maidens.
   Allure the young gallant
   With dance and with song.
   As we lure the young gallant,
   Espy him approaching,
   Disperse yourselves, darlings,
   And pelt him with cherries,
   With cherries, red currants,
   With raspberries, cherries.
   Approach not to hearken
   To secrets of virgins,
   Approach not to gaze at
   The frolics of maidens.

   XLII

   They sang, whilst negligently seated,
   Attentive to the echoing sound,
   Tattiana with impatience waited
   Until her heart less high should bound—
   Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
   But tremor still her frame possessed,
   Nor did her blushes fade away,
   More crimson every moment they.
   Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
   With iridescent wing doth flap
   When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
   Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
   She from the winter corn espies
   A sportsman who in covert lies.

   XLIII

   But finally she heaves a sigh,
   And rising from her bench proceeds;
   But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
   Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
   When Eugene like a ghost did rise
   Before her straight with roguish eyes.
   Tattiana faltered, and became
   Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
   But this adventure's consequence
   To-day, my friends, at any rate,
   I am not strong enough to state;
   I, after so much eloquence,
   Must take a walk and rest a bit—
   Some day I'll somehow finish it.
