      O my Svetlana.'—Joukovski

   Canto The Fifth

   [Note: Mikhailovskoe, 1825-6]

   I

   That year the autumn season late
   Kept lingering on as loath to go,
   All Nature winter seemed to await,
   Till January fell no snow—
   The third at night. Tattiana wakes
   Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
   Park, garden, palings, yard below
   And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
   Upon the windows tracery,
   The trees in silvery array,
   Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
   And the far mountains daintily
   O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
   All so distinct, and all so white!

   II

   Winter! The peasant blithely goes
   To labour in his sledge forgot,
   His pony sniffing the fresh snows
   Just manages a feeble trot
   Though deep he sinks into the drift;
   Forth the <i>kibitka</i> gallops swift,(48)
   Its driver seated on the rim
   In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
   Yonder the household lad doth run,
   Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
   Himself transformed into a hack;
   To freeze his finger hath begun,
   He laughs, although it aches from cold,
   His mother from the door doth scold.

   [Note 48: The "kibitka," properly speaking, whether on wheels
   or runners, is a vehicle with a hood not unlike a big cradle.]

   III

   In scenes like these it may be though,
   Ye feel but little interest,
   They are all natural and low,
   Are not with elegance impressed.
   Another bard with art divine
   Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
   The first appearance of the snows
   And all the joys which Winter knows.
   He will delight you, I am sure,
   When he in ardent verse portrays
   Secret excursions made in sleighs;
   But competition I abjure
   Either with him or thee in song,
   Bard of the Finnish maiden young.(49)

   [Note 49: The allusions in the foregoing stanza are in the first
   place to a poem entitled "The First Snow," by Prince Viazemski
   and secondly to "Eda," by Baratynski, a poem descriptive of life
   in Finland.]

   IV

   Tattiana, Russian to the core,
   Herself not knowing well the reason,
   The Russian winter did adore
   And the cold beauties of the season:
   On sunny days the glistening rime,
   Sledging, the snows, which at the time
   Of sunset glow with rosy light,
   The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
   These evenings as in days of old
   The Larinas would celebrate,
   The servants used to congregate
   And the young ladies fortunes told,
   And every year distributed
   Journeys and warriors to wed.

   V

   Tattiana in traditions old
   Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
   In dreams and what the moon foretold
   And what she from the cards inferred.
   Omens inspired her soul with fear,
   Mysteriously all objects near
   A hidden meaning could impart,
   Presentiments oppressed her heart.
   Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
   With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
   Tattiana certainly infers
   That guests approach: and when above
   The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
   Suddenly to the left hand side,

   VI

   She trembled and grew deadly pale.
   Or a swift meteor, may be,
   Across the gloom of heaven would sail
   And disappear in space; then she
   Would haste in agitation dire
   To mutter her concealed desire
   Ere the bright messenger had set.
   When in her walks abroad she met
   A friar black approaching near,(50)
   Or a swift hare from mead to mead
   Had run across her path at speed,
   Wholly beside herself with fear,
   Anticipating woe she pined,
   Certain misfortune near opined.

   [Note 50: The Russian clergy are divided into two classes:
   the white or secular, which is made up of the mass of parish
   priests, and the black who inhabit the monasteries, furnish
   the high dignitaries of the Church, and constitute that swarm
   of useless drones for whom Peter the Great felt such a deep
   repugnance.]

   VII

   Wherefore? She found a secret joy
   In horror for itself alone,
   Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
   Thus her perversity hath shown.
   Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!(51)
   When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
   Before whose inexperienced sight
   Life lies extended, vast and bright,
   To peer into the future tries.
   Old age through spectacles too peers,
   Although the destined coffin nears,
   Having lost all in life we prize.
   It matters not. Hope e'en to these
   With childlike lisp will lie to please.

   [Note 51: Refers to the "Sviatki" or Holy Nights between Christmas
   Eve and Twelfth Night. Divination, or the telling of fortunes
   by various expedients, is the favourite pastime on these
   occasions.]

   VIII

   Tattiana gazed with curious eye
   On melted wax in water poured;
   The clue unto some mystery
   She deemed its outline might afford.
   Rings from a dish of water full
   In order due the maidens pull;
   But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
   A ring she heard the ancient strain:
   <i>The peasants there are rich as kings,
   They shovel silver with a spade,
   He whom we sing to shall be made
   Happy and glorious</i>. But this brings
   With sad refrain misfortune near.
   Girls the <i>kashourka</i> much prefer.(52)

   [Note 52: During the "sviatki" it is a common custom for the girls
   to assemble around a table on which is placed a dish or basin of
   water which contains a ring. Each in her turn extracts the ring
   from the basin whilst the remainder sing in chorus the "podbliudni
   pessni," or "dish songs" before mentioned. These are popularly
   supposed to indicate the fortunes of the immediate holder of the
   ring. The first-named lines foreshadow death; the latter, the
   "kashourka," or "kitten song," indicates approaching marriage. It
   commences thus: "The cat asked the kitten to sleep on the stove."]

   IX

   Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
   The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
   Sailed silently in unison—
   Tattiana in the yard appears
   In a half-open dressing-gown
   And bends her mirror on the moon,
   But trembling on the mirror dark
   The sad moon only could remark.
   List! the snow crunches—he draws nigh!
   The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
   And her voice sweeter than the sounds
   Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
   "What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
   And "Agathon" replied, amazed.(53)

   [Note 53: The superstition is that the name of the future husband
   may thus be discovered.]

   X

   Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
   By night prepared for sorcery,
   And in the bathroom did command
   To lay two covers secretly.
   But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
   And I, remembering Svetlana,(54)
   Become alarmed. So never mind!
   I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
   So she her silken sash unlaced,
   Undressed herself and went to bed
   And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.(55)
   Beneath her downy pillow placed,
   A little virgin mirror peeps.
   'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.

   [Note 54: See Note 30.]

   [Note 55: Lel, in Slavonic mythology, corresponds to the Morpheus
   of the Latins. The word is evidently connected with the verb
   "leleyat" to fondle or soothe, likewise with our own word
   "to lull."]

   XI

   A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
   She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
   All covered up with snow in heaps,
   By melancholy fogs concealed.
   Amid the snowdrifts which surround
   A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
   Impetuously clove its way
   With boiling torrent dark and gray;
   Two poles together glued by ice,
   A fragile bridge and insecure,
   Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
   Beside the thundering abyss
   Tattiana in despair unfeigned
   Rooted unto the spot remained.

   XII

   As if against obstruction sore
   Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
   To help her to the other shore
   No one appeared to lend a hand.
   But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
   And what from its recess appears?
   A bristly bear of monstrous size!
   He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
   He offers her his murderous paw;
   She nerves herself from her alarm
   And leans upon the monster's arm,
   With footsteps tremulous with awe
   Passes the torrent But alack!
   Bruin is marching at her back!

   XIII

   She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
   Accelerates her hasty pace,
   But cannot anyhow evade
   Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
   The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
   A forest now she sees in front
   With fir-trees standing motionless
   In melancholy loveliness,
   Their branches by the snow bowed down.
   Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
   The shining orbs of night appear;
   There is no path; the storm hath strewn
   Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
   And all in snow is buried deep.

   XIV

   The wood she enters—bear behind,—
   In snow she sinks up to the knee;
   Now a long branch itself entwined
   Around her neck, now violently
   Away her golden earrings tore;
   Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
   Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
   Her handkerchief she loses now;
   No time to pick it up! afraid,
   She hears the bear behind her press,
   Nor dares the skirting of her dress
   For shame lift up the modest maid.
   She runs, the bear upon her trail,
   Until her powers of running fail.

   XV

   She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
   Adroitly seized and carried her;
   Submissive as if in a swoon,
   She cannot draw a breath or stir.
   He dragged her by a forest road
   Till amid trees a hovel showed,
   By barren snow heaped up and bound,
   A tangled wilderness around.
   Bright blazed the window of the place,
   Within resounded shriek and shout:
   "My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.
   "Warm yourself here a little space!"
   Straight for the entrance then he made
   And her upon the threshold laid.

   XVI

   Recovering, Tania gazes round;
   Bear gone—she at the threshold placed;
   Inside clink glasses, cries resound
   As if it were some funeral feast.
   But deeming all this nonsense pure,
   She peeped through a chink of the door.
   What doth she see? Around the board
   Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
   A canine face with horns thereon,
   Another with cock's head appeared,
   Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
   There an imperious skeleton;
   A dwarf adorned with tail, again
   A shape half cat and half a crane.

   XVII

   Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
   A crab upon a spider rides,
   Perched on a goose's neck a skull
   In scarlet cap revolving glides.
   A windmill too a jig performs
   And wildly waves its arms and storms;
   Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
   The speech of man and tramp of horse.
   But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
   When in that company she saw
   Him who inspired both love and awe,
   The hero we immortalize.
   Oneguine sat the table by
   And viewed the door with cunning eye.

   XVIII

   All bustle when he makes a sign:
   He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
   He smiles, in laughter all combine;
   He knits his brows—'tis silent all.
   He there is master—that is plain;
   Tattiana courage doth regain
   And grown more curious by far
   Just placed the entrance door ajar.
   The wind rose instantly, blew out
   The fire of the nocturnal lights;
   A trouble fell upon the sprites;
   Oneguine lightning glances shot;
   Furious he from the table rose;
   All arise. To the door he goes.

   XIX

   Terror assails her. Hastily
   Tattiana would attempt to fly,
   She cannot—then impatiently
   She strains her throat to force a cry—
   She cannot—Eugene oped the door
   And the young girl appeared before
   Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
   Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
   And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
   Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
   Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
   Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
   Are turned upon her. All combine
   In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!

   XX

   "Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
   The troop of apparitions fled,
   And in the frosty night alone
   Remained with him the youthful maid.
   With tranquil air Oneguine leads
   Tattiana to a corner, bids
   Her on a shaky bench sit down;
   His head sinks slowly, rests upon
   Her shoulder—Olga swiftly came—
   And Lenski followed—a light broke—
   His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
   And gazed around with eyes of flame;
   The unbidden guests he roughly chides—
   Tattiana motionless abides.

   XXI

   The strife grew furious and Eugene
   Grasped a long knife and instantly
   Struck Lenski dead—across the scene
   Dark shadows thicken—a dread cry
   Was uttered, and the cabin shook—
   Tattiana terrified awoke.
   She gazed around her—it was day.
   Lo! through the frozen windows play
   Aurora's ruddy rays of light—
   The door flew open—Olga came,
   More blooming than the Boreal flame
   And swifter than the swallow's flight.
   "Come," she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
   Whom you in slumber may have seen."

   XXII

   But she, her sister never heeding,
   With book in hand reclined in bed,
   Page after page continued reading,
   But no reply unto her made.
   Although her book did not contain
   The bard's enthusiastic strain,
   Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
   Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
   Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
   Nor the <i>Journal des Modes</i>, I vouch,
   Ever absorbed a maid so much:
   Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
   The chief of the Chaldean wise,
   Who dreams expound and prophecies.

   XXIII

   Brought by a pedlar vagabond
   Unto their solitude one day,
   This monument of thought profound
   Tattiana purchased with a stray
   Tome of "Malvina," and but three(56)
   And a half rubles down gave she;
   Also, to equalise the scales,
   She got a book of nursery tales,
   A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
   Marmontel also, tome the third;
   Tattiana every day conferred
   With Martin Zadeka. In woe
   She consolation thence obtained—
   Inseparable they remained.

   [Note 56: "Malvina," a romance by Madame Cottin.]

   XXIV

   The dream left terror in its train.
   Not knowing its interpretation,
   Tania the meaning would obtain
   Of such a dread hallucination.
   Tattiana to the index flies
   And alphabetically tries
   The words <i>bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
   Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
   Et cetera</i>; but nothing showed
   Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
   Though the foul vision promise made
   Of a most mournful episode,
   And many a day thereafter laid
   A load of care upon the maid.

   XXV

   "But lo! forth from the valleys dun
   With purple hand Aurora leads,
   Swift following in her wake, the sun,"(57)
   And a grand festival proceeds.
   The Larinas were since sunrise
   O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
   The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
   Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
   Crush and confusion in the hall,
   Latest arrivals' salutations,
   Barking, young ladies' osculations,
   Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
   Bows and the scrape of many feet,
   Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.

   [Note 57: The above three lines are a parody on the turgid
   style of Lomonossoff, a literary man of the second Catherine's
   era.]

   XXVI

   Bringing his partner corpulent
   Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
   Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
   Oppressor of the wretched poor;
   And the Skatenines, aged pair,
   With all their progeny were there,
   Who from two years to thirty tell;
   Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;
   Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore(58)
   His wadded coat and cap with peak
   (Surely you know him as I speak);
   And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
   Rogue and extortioner of yore,
   Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.

   [Note 58: Pushkin calls Bouyanoff his cousin because he is a
   character in the "Dangerous Neighbour," a poem by Vassili
   Pushkin, the poet's uncle.]

   XXVII

   The family of Kharlikoff,
   Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
   Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
   In spectacles and chestnut wig.
   Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
   In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
   Known unto children perfectly:
   <i>Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie</i>.
   Among some ancient ballads thrust,
   He found them in an almanac,
   And the sagacious Triquet back
   To light had brought them from their dust,
   Whilst he "belle Nina" had the face
   By "belle Tattiana" to replace.

   XXVIII

   Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
   Of old maids the divinity,
   And comfort of each country dame,
   The captain of a company.
   He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
   The military band will play.
   The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
   So there will be a dance to-night.
   Girls in anticipation skip!
   But dinner-time comes. Two and two
   They hand in hand to table go.
   The maids beside Tattiana keep—
   Men opposite. The cross they sign
   And chattering loud sit down to dine.

   XXIX

   Ceased for a space all chattering.
   Jaws are at work. On every side
   Plates, knives and forks are clattering
   And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
   But by degrees the crowd begin
   To raise a clamour and a din:
   They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
   They shout and no one lists at all.
   The doors swing open: Lenski makes
   His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
   At last the author!" cries Mamma.
   The guests make room; aside each takes
   His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
   The friends are called and quickly placed.

   XXX

   Right opposite Tattiana placed,
   She, than the morning moon more pale,
   More timid than a doe long chased,
   Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
   Anew the flames of passion start
   Within her; she is sick at heart;
   The two friends' compliments she hears
   Not, and a flood of bitter tears
   With effort she restrains. Well nigh
   The poor girl fell into a faint,
   But strength of mind and self-restraint
   Prevailed at last. She in reply
   Said something in an undertone
   And at the table sat her down.

   XXXI

   To tragedy, the fainting fit,
   And female tears hysterical,
   Oneguine could not now submit,
   For long he had endured them all.
   Our misanthrope was full of ire,
   At a great feast against desire,
   And marking Tania's agitation,
   Cast down his eyes in trepidation
   And sulked in silent indignation;
   Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
   Avenge himself in proper style.
   Triumphant by anticipation,
   Caricatures he now designed
   Of all the guests within his mind.

   XXXII

   Certainly not Eugene alone
   Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
   But that the eyes of every one
   By a rich pie were occupied—
   Unhappily too salt by far;
   And that a bottle sealed with tar
   Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,(59)
   Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
   Behind, of glasses an array,
   Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
   Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
   Fair object of my guileless lay,
   Seductive cup of love, whose flow
   Made me so tipsy long ago!

   [Note 59: The <i>Donskoe Champanskoe</i> is a species of sparkling wine
   manufactured in the vicinity of the river Don.]

   XXXIII

   From the moist cork the bottle freed
   With loud explosion, the bright wine
   Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
   Long tortured by his lay divine,
   Triquet arose, and for the bard
   The company deep silence guard.
   Tania well nigh expired when he
   Turned to her and discordantly
   Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
   Voices and hands applaud, and she
   Must bow in common courtesy;
   The poet, modest though so grand,
   Drank to her health in the first place,
   Then handed her the song with grace.

   XXXIV

   Congratulations, toasts resound,
   Tattiana thanks to all returned,
   But, when Oneguine's turn came round,
   The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
   Her agitation and distress
   Aroused in him some tenderness.
   He bowed to her nor silence broke,
   But somehow there shone in his look
   The witching light of sympathy;
   I know not if his heart felt pain
   Or if he meant to flirt again,
   From habit or maliciously,
   But kindness from his eye had beamed
   And to revive Tattiana seemed.

   XXXV

   The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
   The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
   As bees who leave their dainty store
   And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
   Contented and with victuals stored,
   Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
   Matrons unto the fireplace go,
   Maids in the corner whisper low;
   Behold! green tables are brought forth,
   And testy gamesters do engage
   In boston and the game of age,
   Ombre, and whist all others worth:
   A strong resemblance these possess—
   All sons of mental weariness.

   XXXVI

   Eight rubbers were already played,
   Eight times the heroes of the fight
   Change of position had essayed,
   When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
   Time to denote by dinner, tea,
   And supper. In the country we
   Can count the time without much fuss—
   The stomach doth admonish us.
   And, by the way, I here assert
   That for that matter in my verse
   As many dinners I rehearse,
   As oft to meat and drink advert,
   As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
   Whom thirty centuries adore.

   XXXVII

   I will with thy divinity
   Contend with knife and fork and platter,
   But grant with magnanimity
   I'm beaten in another matter;
   Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
   Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
   Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
   More advantageously appear
   Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
   The aspect of a landscape drear.
   Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
   And fashion's gay frivolities;
   But my Tattiana, on my soul,
   Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.

   XXXVIII

   No one the contrary will urge,
   Though for his Helen Menelaus
   Again a century should scourge
   Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
   Though around honoured Priam's throne
   Troy's sages should in concert own
   Once more, when she appeared in sight,
   Paris and Menelaus right.
   But as to fighting—'twill appear!
   For patience, reader, I must plead!
   A little farther please to read
   And be not in advance severe.
   There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
   My word of honour given have I.

   XXXIX

   The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
   But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
   When in the grand saloon was heard
   Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
   His soul by crash of music fired,
   His tea with rum no more desired,
   The Paris of those country parts
   To Olga Petoushkova darts:
   To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
   A marriageable maid matured,
   The poet from Tamboff secured,
   Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.
   All to the grand saloon are gone—
   The ball in all its splendour shone.

   XL

   I tried when I began this tale,
   (See the first canto if ye will),
   A ball in Peter's capital,
   To sketch ye in Albano's style.(60)
   But by fantastic dreams distraught,
   My memory wandered wide and sought
   The feet of my dear lady friends.
   O feet, where'er your path extends
   I long enough deceived have erred.
   The perfidies I recollect
   Should make me much more circumspect,
   Reform me both in deed and word,
   And this fifth canto ought to be
   From such digressions wholly free.

   [Note 60: Francesco Albano, a celebrated painter, styled the "Anacreon
   of Painting," was born at Bologna 1578, and died in the year 1666.]

   XLI

   The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
   Undeviating and insane
   As giddy youth's hilarity—
   Pair after pair the race sustain.
   The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
   Espying, Eugene with a smile
   Approaches Olga and the pair
   Amid the company career.
   Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
   Begins to talk of this and that,
   But when two minutes she had sat,
   Again the giddy waltz repeats.
   All are amazed; but Lenski he
   Scarce credits what his eyes can see.

   XLII

   Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
   When the mazurka used to peal,
   All rattled in the ball-room vast,
   The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
   And jolting jarred the window-frames.
   'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
   We glide along a floor of wax.
   However, the mazurka lacks
   Nought of its charms original
   In country towns, where still it keeps
   Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
   Fashion is there immutable,
   Who tyrannizes us with ease,
   Of modern Russians the disease.

   XLIII

   Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,
   Unto the hero of this lay
   Olga and Tania led. Malign,
   Oneguine Olga bore away.
   Gliding in negligent career,
   He bending whispered in her ear
   Some madrigal not worth a rush,
   And pressed her hand—the crimson blush
   Upon her cheek by adulation
   Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
   Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
   And hot with jealous indignation,
   Till the mazurka's close he stays,
   Her hand for the cotillon prays.

   XLIV

   She fears she cannot.—Cannot? Why?—
   She promised Eugene, or she would
   With great delight.—O God on high!
   Heard he the truth? And thus she could—
   And can it be? But late a child
   And now a fickle flirt and wild,
   Cunning already to display
   And well-instructed to betray!
   Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
   At womankind he growled a curse,
   Departed, ordered out his horse
   And galloped home. But pistols twain,
   A pair of bullets—nought beside—
   His fate shall presently decide.
